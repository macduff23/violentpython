This is my notes and work for Violent Python - available [here](https://repo.zenk-security.com/Programmation/Violent%20Python%20a%20Cookbook%20for%20Hackers-Forensic%20Analysts-Penetration%20testers%20and%20Security%20Engineers.pdf)

I've previously worked through about half of the work in Learning Python the Hard Way and an Udemy course, but they teach a lot of things I don't care about, like adding and stuff. I'm sure it'll come in handy eventually, but learning by doing always seems much easier for me. 

I may start and stop this depending on how my priorities change, but I hope to steadily contribute to this until I'm done. I guess only time will tell.

I'll heavily comment where possible to show why and how I did the things that I did. Some of the stuff will look unfinished. If I moved on, its because I got the point and don't want to beat a dead horse.
