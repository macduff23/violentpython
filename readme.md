This is my notes and work for Violent Python - available in places i won't link because maybe they're not legit even though google will find them quick. 

I've previously worked through about half of the work in Learning Python the Hard Way and an Udemy course, but they teach a lot of things I don't care about, like adding and stuff. I'm sure it'll come in handy eventually, but learning by doing always seems much easier for me. 

I may start and stop this depending on how my priorities change, but I hope to steadily contribute to this until I'm done. I guess only time will tell.

I'll heavily comment where possible to show why and how I did the things that I did. Some of the stuff will look unfinished. If I moved on, its because I got the point and don't want to beat a dead horse.

I decided to do this as a github repo with notes on chapter 2. There's no notes for chapter one and I think i skipped some parts. Deal with it.
